This adaptable and versatile application is designed to easily adjust to your own data and produce impactful, professional visualizations. Unlike traditional statistical applications (with preloaded datasets), this one allows you to import your own database and conduct graphical analyses without any coding. 😏

Simply enter a username and password to access all features. The application automatically detects variable types (quantitative or qualitative) and suggests appropriate charts, while also allowing you to set custom filters. It offers bivariate descriptive analyses and can be used to present study results without needing to log out.
